# Quora Insincere Questions Classification using Text Preprocessing Technique TF-IDF

### Dataset Link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data

## Objective: 
The project aims to classify Quora questions as sincere or insincere.
## Data Preparation: 
The data is retrieved from a Kaggle competition and processed using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

## Modeling Approaches:
### Logistic Regression: 
A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using PyTorch, employing binary cross-entropy, accuracy, and F1 score metrics.

### Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN): 
A feed-forward neural network architecture is implemented but not fully trained in the provided code.

### Training and Evaluation: 
The training loop for both models is outlined, showcasing the process of model training, validation, and performance tracking.

### Visualization: 
Metrics such as loss, accuracy, and F1 scores across epochs are visualized using Matplotlib.


This project primarily revolves around text preprocessing, utilization of a logistic regression model, and initial setup of a neural network for classifying Quora questions based on their sincerity.
